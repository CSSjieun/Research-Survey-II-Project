PROJECT CONTEXT:

This project origins from a Survey Methodology course's assignment. 

The assignment has two primary objectives:

1. Explaining Cross-Country Differences in Support Levels: This aspect involves analyzing the
data to understand why different countries exhibit varying levels of support for transgender individuals
obtaining official documents (cq19 in the questionnare). Individual-level indicators need to be complemented with country-level factors such as cultural norms, legal systems, history, economic-related
variables, and societal views on LGBTI rights.

2. Developing a Predictive Model for Other Countries This task involves building a model to
predict support for transgender individuals changing civil documents to align with their gender identity.

By using factors identified in the first part of the assignment, machine learning techniques will be
applied to forecast support levels based on observed trends. To ensure the model’s accuracy and
reliability, it must undergo thorough calibration and validation. Key steps in this process include
selecting relevant features (variables), choosing an appropriate modeling method (such as regression
analysis, decision trees, neural networks, etc.), training the model with survey data, and subsequently
testing its predictions against known outcomes.


ABOUT THE DATA
The Special Eurobarometer 493: Discrimination in the EU focuses on person’s perceptions, attitudes and
opinions of discrimination based on ethnic origin, skin colour, sexual orientation, gender, age, disability,
